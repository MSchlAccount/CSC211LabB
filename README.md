# CSC211LabB
This is my code for Lab B Assignment. This assignment creates an application that allows a user to store any issues about a project. The file that I created 
is IssueTrackingLite.fxml, as per the tutorial. The file IssueTrackingLiteComplete.fxml is the tutorial's final version of the application.
